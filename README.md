# Summary

The **lab streaming layer** (LSL) is a system for the unified collection of measurement time series in research experiments that handles both the networking, time-synchronization, (near-) real-time access as well as optionally the centralized collection, viewing and disk recording of the data.
You can find more information about the lab streaming layer [here](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer)

# Changes
This repository contains some new applications for the lab streaming layer developed by the [Laboratory of Brain-Computer Interfaces at Graz, University of Technology](https://bci.tugraz.at/).

New applications are listed below: 
  * **ANT Eego Sports**: The LSL application for the 64bit ANT Eego Sports amplifier can be found [here](https://github.com/matthiasschlesinger/labstreaminglayer/tree/master/Apps)
